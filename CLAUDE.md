# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview
This is an Ansible-based homelab automation project that transforms fresh Ubuntu installations into fully-configured CI/CD infrastructure nodes. The project **evolved from a golden image approach** to a **direct fresh install automation approach** using a streamlined bootstrap process followed by comprehensive automated configuration.

## Quick Start Commands

### Fresh Install Setup (3-step process)
```bash
# Step 1: Copy SSH keys to fresh install
./setup_ssh.sh

# Step 2: Bootstrap system (prompts for sudo password once)
./bootstrap.sh

# Step 3: Complete homelab setup (fully automated)
./setup_homelab.sh
```

### Manual Playbook Execution
```bash
# Run master orchestration playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventories/homelab.ini site.yml

# Run specific playbook against homelab inventory
ansible-playbook -i inventories/homelab.ini playbooks/<playbook_name>.yml

# Bootstrap fresh install (requires sudo password)
ansible-playbook -i inventories/homelab.ini playbooks/bootstrap_fresh_install.yml --ask-become-pass
```

### Ansible Syntax Validation
```bash
# Check playbook syntax
ansible-playbook --syntax-check -i inventories/homelab.ini <playbook>.yml

# List tasks without executing
ansible-playbook --list-tasks -i inventories/homelab.ini <playbook>.yml

# Test connectivity
ansible all -i inventories/homelab.ini -m ping
```

## Architecture

### Current Deployment Approach
**Fresh Install â†’ Direct Automation (NEW APPROACH)**
1. Manual Ubuntu Server installation on target hardware
2. SSH key setup via `setup_ssh.sh` (uses standard ssh-copy-id)
3. Bootstrap via `bootstrap.sh` (one-time password prompt for sudo setup)
4. Complete automated setup via `setup_homelab.sh` (15-20 minutes, fully unattended)

**Previous Approach (Deprecated):** Golden image creation was abandoned due to complexity and maintenance overhead. The direct automation approach is more flexible and easier to maintain.

### Playbook Execution Order (via site.yml)
The `site.yml` master playbook orchestrates a 7-phase setup:
1. **OS Updates** (`update_os.yml`) - System packages and updates
2. **SSH Security** (`configure_ssh.yml`) - Security hardening
3. **Docker** (`install_docker.yml`) - Docker CE installation
4. **Kubernetes** (`install_kubernetes.yml`) - MicroK8s with addons
5. **Platform Tools** (`install_platform_tools.yml`) - kubectl, helm, essential utilities
6. **Users** (`setup_users.yml`) - Create labuser account with permissions
7. **System Config** (`configure_systems.yml`) - Container optimizations, lid behavior, swap disable

### Key Design Patterns
- **No Roles**: All functionality implemented directly in playbooks under `playbooks/` (consistent with original design)
- **Variable Hierarchy**: Global vars in `group_vars/all.yml` (corrected from original `vars.yml` reference)
- **Master Playbook**: `site.yml` orchestrates all phases with progress tracking and error handling
- **Bootstrap Pattern**: Separate bootstrap phase handles fresh install prerequisites
- **3-Step Process**: setup_ssh.sh â†’ bootstrap.sh â†’ setup_homelab.sh (no sshpass dependency)
- **Idempotent Design**: All playbooks can be safely re-run

### Network Configuration
- **Current Target**: 10.0.0.175 (defined in `inventories/homelab.ini`)
- **Planned Cluster**:
  - **controlplane**: 10.0.0.135 (laptop #1)
  - **worker1**: 10.0.0.136 (laptop #2)  
  - **worker2**: 10.0.0.137 (laptop #3)
- **Network**: 10.0.0.x subnet, WiFi "Worf", Gateway 10.0.0.1

### Important Variables
- **ansible_user**: Set to "davidg" in `group_vars/all.yml`
- **ssh_public_key**: Ed25519 key for passwordless authentication
- **Users Created**: davidg (primary), labuser (secondary) - both with full sudo/docker/k8s access

### Current Technology Stack
- **Base OS**: Ubuntu Server 24.04.2 LTS
- **Container Platform**: Docker CE + MicroK8s (Kubernetes)
- **Platform Management**: kubectl, Helm (for Kubernetes operations)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Ansible for configuration management
- **Authentication**: SSH key-based, passwordless sudo

## Completed Features âœ…
- **3-step bootstrap process** for fresh Ubuntu installs (eliminates sshpass dependency)
- **Master site.yml playbook** with 7-phase automated setup and progress tracking
- **Minimal container platform** with Docker and Kubernetes ready for workloads
- **Platform management tools** kubectl and Helm for Kubernetes operations
- **Dual user setup** (davidg primary, labuser secondary) with full permissions
- **System optimization** for Kubernetes workloads (swap disable, network config, lid behavior)
- **SSH security hardening** with key-only authentication and passwordless sudo
- **Complete automation** - 15-20 minute full setup from fresh Ubuntu install
- **Error handling and recovery** - playbooks are idempotent and resumable

## Next Phase: Cloud-Native Architecture ðŸš€

### Current Challenge
The current approach installs development tools directly on bare metal, which doesn't align with cloud-native practices. We need to containerize and distribute development tools via Kubernetes.

### Planned Transformation
**From**: Bare metal with tools installed directly
**To**: Bare metal as infrastructure foundation + containerized development environments

### Tomorrow's Task List

#### Phase 1: Architecture Redesign âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Created minimal base platform**
  - [x] Removed all development tools from playbooks
  - [x] Created new `install_platform_tools.yml` with only kubectl/helm
  - [x] Kept only: OS, Docker, MicroK8s, essential system config
  - [x] Maintained user accounts and SSH security

#### Phase 2: Containerization
- [ ] **Design unified development container image**
  - [ ] Single container with all development languages:
    - [ ] Node.js development environment

    - [ ] Python development environment
  
- [ ] **Create Dockerfile for unified development environment**
  - [ ] Include all necessary development dependencies
  - [ ] Multi-stage build for optimization
  - [ ] Proper user permissions and workspace setup
  - [ ] Common development workflows and aliases

- [ ] **Documentation and workflows**
  - [ ] How to use containerized development tools
  - [ ] Best practices for cloud-native development
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide

#### Phase 5: Integration & Testing
- [ ] **Update site.yml master playbook**
  - [ ] Remove direct tool installation phases
  - [ ] Add Kubernetes deployment phases
  - [ ] Test complete workflow
  
- [ ] **Validation & refinement**
  - [ ] Ensure all development workflows work in containers
  - [ ] Performance testing and optimization

### Benefits of New Architecture
- **Infrastructure Separation**: Clean host OS with only container runtime
- **Cloud Alignment**: Mimics production cloud environments
- **Resource Management**: Proper limits and isolation
- **Scalability**: Easy to distribute across multiple nodes
- **Flexibility**: Multiple tool versions, disposable environments
- **Consistency**: Same development environment regardless of hardware
